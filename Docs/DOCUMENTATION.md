# Full-Stack Express Template Documentation

This document explains the design, features, and benefits of the template for both backend and frontend developers.

## Overview

This Express Template is built using TypeScript, Prisma, and security best practices. It provides a solid foundation for backend development while offering resources that frontend developers can leverage to integrate seamlessly with the API.

## Template Architecture

- **Backend Framework**: Express with TypeScript ensures type safety and clear code structure.
- **Database Management**: Prisma simplifies interactions with PostgreSQL, making migrations and data modeling straightforward.
- **Security**: The template is equipped with Helmet, rate limiting, input validation, and API key middleware to secure endpoints.
- **Documentation**: Swagger is used to automatically generate interactive API documentation.
- **Testing**: Jest and Supertest are preconfigured for robust unit and integration testing.
- **Logging & Error Handling**: Integrated Winston logger and custom error classes help with debugging and maintaining operational integrity.

## Benefits for Backend Developers

- **Scalability and Maintainability**: TypeScript and modular file structure help maintain clean and scalable code.
- **Security Best Practices**: Built-in protections against common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, injection attacks) and clear error handling.
- **Rapid Development**: Predefined routes, controllers, and utilities accelerate backend development without sacrificing quality.
- **Database Integration**: Prisma simplifies database interactions with automatic type generation and powerful migration tools.
- **Testing & Quality Assurance**: The template offers comprehensive test setups, linting, and formatting tools to ensure code quality.

## Benefits for Frontend Developers

- **Consistent API Design**: Versioned API endpoints and Swagger documentation provide a clear and consistent interface for integration.
- **Clear Data Contracts**: JSON responses with error handling and validation ensure reliable communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Ready-to-use endpoints for authentication, registration, and external services allow frontend developers to quickly hook up the UI with minimal backend adjustments.
- **Extensible Integration**: Features like API key protected endpoints allow secure integrations with third-party and frontend services.

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- PostgreSQL
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdulaziz-alhashedi/express_F_S/.git
   cd express-template
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Choose your preferred package manager:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Copy the sample environment file and update the necessary keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   - For development:
     ```bash
     pnpm dev
     ```
   - For production:
     ```bash
     pnpm build
     pnpm start
     ```

### Prisma and Database Setup

- **Generate Prisma Client**:
  ```bash
  npx prisma generate
  ```
- **Run Migrations**:
  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate dev
  ```
- **Seed the Database** (if applicable):
  ```bash
  npx prisma db seed
  ```

### Docker Deployment

1. **Build and Run Containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
2. Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## API Documentation

The template includes a Swagger UI endpoint for interactive API documentation:
- **Access Swagger**: [http://localhost:3000/api/v1/docs](http://localhost:3000/api/v1/docs)

## Conclusion

This template streamlines backend development while ensuring clear and consistent API communication that benefits frontend developers. It is designed to accelerate development and promote best practices across the stack.

Happy coding!
