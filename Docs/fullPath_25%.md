# Full Path Explanation for Express Template

This document explains the overall design of the template, how to use it, and the role each major package plays – with each highlighted package contributing at least 25% to the core functionality.

## Template Architecture Overview

- **Directory Structure**: 
  - `src`: Contains controllers, routes, middlewares, and utilities.
  - `prisma`: Holds the database schema and migration files.
  - `tests`: Provides unit and integration tests using Jest and Supertest.
  - Other files (e.g., README.md, DOCUMENTATION.md) describe usage and setup.

## How to Use the Template

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   - Using npm: `npm install`
   - Using yarn: `yarn install`
   - Using pnpm: `pnpm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set appropriate values.
3. Generate the Prisma client and apply migrations:
   - `npx prisma generate`
   - `npx prisma migrate dev`
4. Start the development server:
   - `pnpm dev`
5. Access API documentation at `/api/v1/docs` via Swagger UI.

## Package Breakdown and Their Roles

- **Express (≈ 25%)**:  
  Forms the backbone of the application, managing routing, middleware, and server logic.

- **TypeScript (≈ 25%)**:  
  Provides static type checking and strongly typed structures, ensuring code quality and maintainability.

- **Prisma (≈ 25%)**:  
  Handles database operations, schema migrations, and provides type-safe database queries.

- **Security & Utility Packages (≈ 25% Combined)**:
  - **Helmet**: Secures HTTP headers.
  - **express-rate-limit**: Protects against abuse by limiting request rates.
  - **express-validator**: Validates and sanitizes incoming requests.
  - **Other Packages** (like cors, mongo-sanitize, and winston) contribute to robustness, error logging, and overall security.

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined above and understanding each package’s contribution, you can leverage this template to create secure, efficient, and scalable web applications.
