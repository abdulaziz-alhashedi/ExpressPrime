# Tasks Management App Backend Integration Report

This report outlines how to use the current Express template as the backend for your React-based tasks management app.

## 1. Project Overview

- **Express Template Features**: 
  - REST API with secure JWT-based authentication.
  - CRUD endpoints (e.g., user registration, login, profile) built-in.
  - Modular design with clear separation of controllers, services, routes, and middlewares.
  - Prisma ORM for database connectivity and migrations.
  - Utility scripts for API generation and admin creation.

## 2. Extending the Template for Task Management

### Data Model Enhancement
- **Step 1**: Update the Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`) to include a new `Task` model.
  - Example properties for a task include:
    - `id`: Primary key.
    - `title`: String (task title).
    - `description`: String (task details).
    - `status`: Enum or string (e.g., pending, completed).
    - `userId`: Foreign key to relate a task to a user.
- **Step 2**: Run migrations and generate a new Prisma client.

### API Endpoints
- **Step 3**: Create task endpoints:
  - Use the provided API generation tool (`scripts/generateApi.ts`) to scaffold the new module (e.g., Task).
  - Alternatively, manually create routes (`src/routes/task.routes.ts`), controllers (`src/controllers/task.controller.ts`), and services (`src/services/task.service.ts`) for handling tasks.
- **Step 4**: Implement input validation and authorization (e.g., only authenticated users can create, view, update, or delete their tasks).

## 3. Connecting the React Frontend

- **Backend Consumption**:
  - Use libraries like Axios or the Fetch API in your React app to connect to the backend endpoints.
  - Manage JWT tokens to authenticate requests to secure endpoints.
- **Tasks Management**:
  - Create views to display tasks, add new tasks, update existing tasks, and delete tasks.
  - Handle error responses and loading states appropriately.

## 4. Frontend Integration

### React Application Setup
- Create a new React application using Create React App, Vite, or your preferred setup.
- Configure environment variables (e.g., REACT_APP_API_URL) to point to your backend API.

### Implementing Task Management Features
- Develop components for listing tasks, task details, and forms for adding/updating tasks.
- Use state management using the Context API or Redux to handle authentication and tasks state.
- Secure the frontend by storing JWT tokens (in localStorage or cookies) and sending them with API requests.

### Connecting to the Backend
- Use Axios or Fetch API to interact with endpoints such as `/api/v1/auth/login`, `/api/v1/auth/register`, and the new task endpoints.
- Handle asynchronous API calls with proper error handling and state updates.

## 5. Running and Testing

- **Local Setup**:
  - Configure your `.env` file with the correct database URL, JWT secrets, and other necessary environment variables.
  - Start the backend server using `npm run dev`.
  - Test endpoints using tools like Postman to verify the new task routes.
- **Integration**:
  - Once verified, integrate these endpoints in your React application and ensure CORS is configured properly for cross-origin requests.

## 6. Next Steps

- Extend user authentication to allow users to own tasks.
- Consider implementing role-based access if administrators have extra permissions over tasks.
- Follow best practices for error handling and logging already present in the template.

This report should serve as a starting point for how to adapt the template for your tasks management app backend.
