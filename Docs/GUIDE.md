# Guide for Backend Developers

This guide is designed to help backend developers quickly understand, set up, and extend the project. Follow these steps to get started.

## 1. Environment Setup
- Clone the repository.
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update environment variables as needed.

## 2. Installation
- Run your preferred package manager command to install dependencies:
  - `pnpm install` or `npm install` or `yarn install`

## 3. Database Preparation
- Generate the Prisma client:
  - `npx prisma generate`
- Run migrations:
  - `npx prisma migrate dev`
  <!-- Note: If you add new models such as "Task", remember to re-run migrations to update the database schema. -->

## 4. Development
- Start the development server:
  - `pnpm dev`
- Explore the pre-built routes, controllers, and middleware to understand the backend logic.
- Extend or modify the code in `src/` as your features require.

## 5. Testing and Iteration
- Run tests to ensure everything works as expected:
  - `npm test`
- Add or modify tests in the `tests/` folder if you extend functionality.

## 6. Additional Resources
- Refer to [fullPath_25%.md](./fullPath_25%.md), [fullPath_50%.md](./fullPath_50%.md), and [fullPath_100%.md](./fullPath_100%.md) for more detailed explanations.
- Check out the README for a full project overview.
- For troubleshooting and advanced configuration, consult the comprehensive guides.

Happy coding!

## 7. Project Ideas
Here are some ideas to kick off your project:
- Create a mini CRUD API for a simple resource (e.g., tasks, notes) to familiarize yourself with setup, routing, and database integration.
- Develop a basic authentication system using JWT to secure endpoints and manage user sessions.
- Implement real-time features (like notifications or chat) using WebSockets to explore event-driven architecture.
- Add extensive logging and monitoring by integrating tools like Winston with performance tracking.
- Build a microservice or modular component that can serve as the basis for scalability later on.
