# Express Template with TypeScript, Prisma, and Security Best Practices

Welcome to the Express Template! This template is designed to help backend developers quickly set up a robust and secure Express application using TypeScript, Prisma, and various security best practices. Whether you're starting a new open-source project or building a production-ready application, this template has you covered.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed language that helps catch errors early and improves code quality.
- **Prisma**: Modern database toolkit that simplifies database access and migrations.
- **Security Best Practices**: Includes middleware for security headers, rate limiting, input validation, and more.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses `dotenv` for environment variable management.
- **Linting and Formatting**: Pre-configured with ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style.
- **Testing**: Set up with Jest for unit and integration tests.
- **Docker Support**: Docker Compose configuration for easy setup and deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)
- PostgreSQL (if not using Docker)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abdulaziz-alhashedi/express_F_S/.git
    cd express-template
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    - Using pnpm:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
    - Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    - Using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
    - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. **Run the application**:
    - For development:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    - For production:
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    pnpm start
    ```

### Using Docker

1. **Build and run the containers**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

2. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Prisma Setup

1. **Generate Prisma client**:
    ```bash
    npx prisma generate
    ```

2. **Run migrations**:
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

### Project Structure

- **src**: Contains the source code.
  - **controllers**: Define the request handlers.
  - **middlewares**: Custom middleware functions.
  - **utils**: Utility functions and configurations.
- **prisma**: Prisma schema and migrations.
- **tests**: Test files.

### Security Features

- **Helmet**: Adds security headers to HTTP responses.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of requests from a single IP.
- **Input Validation**: Validates and sanitizes user input using `express-validator`.
- **Mongo Sanitize**: Prevents MongoDB Operator Injection.
